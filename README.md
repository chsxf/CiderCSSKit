# ‚ùì About This Project

CiderCSSKit is lightweight CSS parser written as a pure Swift package.
It was primarily designed to work with [CiderKit](https://github.com/chsxf/CiderKit), but the goal is to make it as agnostic as possible.

# ü™Ñ Features

CiderCSSKit is still a work-in-progress. So many CSS features are not currenlty supported.

Here's the list of existing and missing features:

- provides easy access to style properties, in bulk or individually
- named colors are already implemented
- built-in functions are limited to `rgb` and `rgba`
- complex CSS combinators (`>`, `+`, and `~`) are not implemented
- no support pseudo-elements (like `::first-line` for example)
- no support for parametric pseudo-classes (like `:nth-child()` for example)
- no support for attribute selectors (like `a[target]` or `a[target="_blank"]`)

## Supported Attributes

The list of supported attributes is fairly limited for now but will expand over time.

- `background-color`
- `border-image` and its sub-attributes
    - `border-image-outset`
    - `border-image-repeat`
    - `border-image-slice`
    - `border-image-source`
    - `border-image-width`
- `color`
- `font` and its sub-attributes
    - `font-family`
    - `font-size`
    - `font-stretch`
    - `font-style`
    - `font-variant`
    - `font-weight`
    - `line-height`
- `padding` and its sub-attributes
    - `padding-bottom`
    - `padding-left`
    - `padding-right`
    - `padding-top`
- `text-align`
- `transform-origin`
- `vertical-align`

## Planned improvements

Even if the ultimate goal is to support all syntax features, there is a long road ahead. Below is a list of short-term planned improvements:

- [ ] Add support for `hsl()` color function ([#12](https://github.com/chsxf/CiderCSSKit/issues/12))
- [ ] Add support for the adjacent sibling combinator (`+`) ([#6](https://github.com/chsxf/CiderCSSKit/issues/6))
- [ ] Add support for the child combinator (`>`) ([#7](https://github.com/chsxf/CiderCSSKit/issues/7))
- [ ] Add support for the general sibling combinator (`~`) ([#8](https://github.com/chsxf/CiderCSSKit/issues/8))
- [ ] Provides basic validation configurations for most common attributes, functions and keywords
